 * Lab 00 Connectivity
 *
 * Confirms the gateway is reachable and reports a node identity, a chain id,
 * and a head height. This is the ground truth every other live lab builds on.
 *
 * What this proves is that the gateway answers and the node is producing blocks.
 * What it does NOT prove is anything about the cryptography. See
 * docs/what-the-labs-prove.md.
 *
 * Run  QUANTOVA_GATEWAY_URL=https://testnet.quantova.io npm run lab:connectivity
