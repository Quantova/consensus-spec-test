/**
 * Lab 05 Finality Stability
 *
 * QORUS finality is attested by the committee with ML-DSA-65 signatures. Once a
 * block is finalized it does not reorganize. This lab reads a finalized block,
 * re reads it, and confirms the hash is stable, and it checks that the gap
 * between the head and the last finalized height stays bounded over a short
 * sampling window.
 *
 * What this proves is that on the node observed, finalized history is stable over
 * the window and finality lag is bounded. What it does NOT prove is safety under
 * adversarial conditions. That is a matter for the QORUS specification and for
 * audit, not for a sampling window on one node. See docs/what-the-labs-prove.md.
 *
 * Run  QUANTOVA_GATEWAY_URL=https://testnet.quantova.io npm run lab:finality
