 * Lab 02 No Elliptic Curve
 *
 * Confirms the account layer is post quantum. Quantova addresses are Q1 bech32m
 * strings written with a capital Q, derived from an ML-DSA-65 public key. There
 * is no ecrecover and no secp256k1 recovery path, because there is no elliptic
 * curve anywhere in the chain.
 *
 * What this proves is that addresses are Q1 bech32m, not 20 byte hex, and the
 * gateway exposes no elliptic curve recovery method. What it does NOT prove is the
 * absence of a classical path in some unrelated component. See docs/what-the-labs-prove.md.

 * Run  QUANTOVA_GATEWAY_URL=https://testnet.quantova.io npm run lab:no-ec
