/**
 * Lab 03 Committee Sortition
 *
 * QORUS is a committee byzantine fault tolerant protocol. Each round is decided
 * by a committee drawn by sortition from the validator registry, and the
 * committee is budget bounded, so its size stays under a cap set in chain
 * params even as the registry grows. Finality is attested by the committee with
 * ML-DSA-65 signatures.
 *
 * This lab inspects the committee. It confirms the validators endpoint returns
 * an active committee, that the committee size stays within the budget the
 * chain reports, and that recent block authors are drawn from the validator
 * registry rather than a single fixed author.
 *
 * What this proves is that leadership runs through a bounded sortition committee,
 * not a fixed or unbounded author set. What it does NOT prove is that the sortition
 * draw is unbiased or unpredictable. That rests on the QORUS specification and on
 * audit, not on an inspection from outside the node. See docs/what-the-labs-prove.md.
 *
 * Run  QUANTOVA_GATEWAY_URL=https://testnet.quantova.io npm run lab:sortition
